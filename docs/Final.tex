    \begin{abstract}
        We put forward an idea and a prototype for an open-source, low-power, polling system built on traditional blockchain technology to decentralise the election process in developing nations in order to protect democracy and prevent voter fraud. Simple resource-efficient hashing mechanisms are used in order to ensure energy-efficiency but at the same time rely on the safety in scale approach to preventing attacks in the electoral process. Limitations of the voter-registration process and partial decentralisation problems are carefully examined and solutions are proposed for the same. \\
