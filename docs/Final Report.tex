\title{Protecting democracy with a trustless blockchain based decentralised election system}

	\begin{abstract}
		Democracy fades as sophisticated attempts of voterfraud are detected, with some even succeeding. VoteBlock attempts to protect democracy by decentralising the election process to ensure the lack of a single point of failure or control, with the help of a blockchain. It must be understood that while VoteBlock secures the election process, it does not secure the voter registration process essential for authorizing each voter.

	\section{Introduction}
	\section{Structure of A Block}
	\subsection{Components}
	Each block consists of the following elements essential to recording votes and identifying induviduality of each voter.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Index - To enumerate each block
		\item Transactions - The given transactions in each block (votes)
		\item Timestamp - The timestamp of each block's creation
		\item Previous Hash - The hash of the previous block to facilitate the blockchain
		\item Nonce - The number only used once. Used to supplement the rest of the data to generate a desired hash pattern
	\end{enumerate}
	\subsection{Hashing}
	SHA-256 hashing is used, where the data of the block is first dumped into a string, and then computed after being unicode encoded.
	\subsection{Code Used}
	\textbf{block.py}
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
from hashlib import sha256
import json

class Block:
	def __init__(self, index, transactions, timestamp, previous_hash, nonce=0):
			self.index = index
			self.transactions = transactions
			self.timestamp = timestamp
			self.previous_hash = previous_hash
			self.nonce = nonce

	def compute_hash(self):
		block_string = json.dumps(self.__dict__, sort_keys=True)
		return sha256(block_string.encode()).hexdigest()
